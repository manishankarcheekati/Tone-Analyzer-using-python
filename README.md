Overview

This is a Tone Analyzer written in Python.It works by compiling the code with the given three parameters where you need to give the file directory username and password in the time of compiling (python tone_analyze.py dir_name username password), it will use that text as a parameter and query the Watson Tone Analyzer API. The API will
return the tone analysis as JSON that you can view in terminal.


*Make sure to sign up for IBM's BlueMix and sign up for the Tone Analyzer service.
Use those credentials and use them during Compiling and have a text file of your own.*
